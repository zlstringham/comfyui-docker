Another take on a dockerized version of the phenomenal [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

Goals:
- Simplicity. I want to simply be able to `docker compose up comfyui` and have it "just work."
- Data persistence in host.
- Extensions should work as expected.
- Automated releases as ComfyUI is updated.
- Have a "toolkit" of dockerized popular Stable Diffusion apps that can share the same models.

Non-Goals:
- Non-CUDA support.

TODO:
- [ ] Install a bunch of extensions and make sure they work and don't need more packages installed.
